        Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) consist of 4 key areas
        1. Context: Add context about the problem you're facing
        2. Decision: The solution you decided to go with to solve the problem
        3. Alternatives: Any other ways you thought you could solve the problem
        4. Consequences: Any issues that may arise in the future due to commiting to this decision

        __Note__: Consequences don't have to be a bad thing, its just leaving a clue to your future self of what may happen so you can prepare for it. Example: If we get 1 million more users, this will stop working. That is complete a acceptable 
        risk profile to take when you have a total of 3 users.
